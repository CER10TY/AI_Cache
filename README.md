# SCW - Spawn, Cache, Waypointing

This collection of scripts is built to handle AI spawning, AI caching (during mission) and AI waypointing in a more light manner than DAC 3.1b.

It is intended to interact with AI mods such as VCOM AI, which handle garrisoning of buildings etc.

The hope is to have each part modular so it can be ripped out and used elsewhere easily.
